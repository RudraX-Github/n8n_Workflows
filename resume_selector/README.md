## 🛠️ Technical Workflow Architecture

### 1. Intake & Extraction
* **Form Trigger:** A user-friendly n8n form allows candidates or recruiters to upload resumes in `.pdf` format.
* **Binary-to-Text:** The workflow converts the binary PDF data into searchable text, preserving the source for downstream metadata usage.

### 2. The AI Screening Layer
* **The "HR Brain" (LLM Chain):** Powered by the **Google Gemini Chat Model**, the system evaluates the candidate specifically for a **Python Developer** role requiring **Docker** and **SQL** knowledge.
* **Zero-Shot Prompting:** The AI follows strict instructions to output only a single word, preventing parsing errors and ensuring clean logic.

### 3. Logic & Response
* **Switch Node:** Routes the workflow based on the AI's "Yes" or "No" string output.
* **Gmail Integration:**
    * **Matched (Yes):** Triggers an invitation to `kddeveloper324@gmail.com` with dynamic placeholders for candidate names.
    * **Unmatched (No):** Triggers a rejection notice to `krunalv1510@gmail.com`, citing specific technical gaps like Docker or backend development.
